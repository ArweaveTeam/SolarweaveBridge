An easy, simple and effective way to store Solana Blocks into Arweave via command line. Solarweave's core objective is to make it as easy as possible to navigate, store and analyze blocks from Solana.

Solarweave uses extensive tag annotations in order to make it as easy as possible to navigate the database via `ArQL`. Check the **ArQL** section to learn more.

If you want to review the benchmarks for Solarweave, check out the [Benchmarks](./BENCHMARKS.md) file!

----

## Getting started

First install `solarweave` via `npm` or `yarn`

**Note that this package is not on the public npm registry and you'll have to use `npm link` or run commands from the git repository.**

```bash
npm install solarweave --global
```

*or*

```bash
yarn global add solarweave
```

You should be then able to run the `solarweave` help command which will output the following:

```bash
solarweave help

Usage: Solarweave Bridge [options] [command]

Options:
  --database [name]          the name of the database (for Arweave ArQL tags) (default: "solarweave-devnet")
  --url [RPC URL]            the Solana RPC URL to query blocks from (default: "https://devnet.solana.com")
  --credentials [file path]  specify the path to the json file containing your Arweave credentials (default: ".arweave.creds.json")
  --local                    cache locally to a JSON file instead of to Arweave (default: false)
  --localFile [file path]    if caching data locally, specify the file path (default: "solarweave.cache.json")
  --console                  do not output log data to console (default: false)
  --uncompressed             store blocks in an uncompressed format (default: false)
  --parallelize [blocks]     the amount of blocks to process at a time, 1 processes 1 block at a time, 8, 8 blocks at a time (default: "1")
  --benchmark                benchmark Solarweave and start tracking size and speed stats stored in benchmark.json (default: false)
  --noverify                 if caching to Arweave do not double check if the block was already submitted (default: false)  -h, --help                     display help for command        

Commands:
  balance                    retrieve the public address and balance of your Arweave wallet
  latest                     retrieve the latest block and output the block to console
  livestream                 livestream blocks directly to your arweave database (or locally)
  cache                      retrieve all the blocks that are still available and store them in Arweave
  help [command]             display help for command  
```

#### Setting credentials

In order to use the Solarweave bridge. *You must have Arweave credentials readily available with tokens*. You can store credentials in the root project directory under `.arweave.creds.json`. Or, whilst using the command line tool. You can pass in your credentials manually.

```bash
solarweave --credentials /path/to/.arweave.creds.json
```

---

## Storing Blocks to Arweave

Before attempting to store data with Solarweave. First check and make sure that you can store data into Arweave by running the `balance` command.

```bash
$ solarweave balance

Your Arweave public address is 1seRanklLU_1VTGkEk7P0xAwMJfA7owA1JHW5KyZKlY
Your Arweave balance is 149998554627
```

If you can't see your public address and balance. It means your `.arweave.creds.json` is not properly configured. Make sure to have a sufficent balance to post data too.

Furthermore, you can also run the `latest` command to make sure you have a working connection with Solana.

```bash
$ solarweave latest

Preparing to retrieve the latest block

Found Block with Parent Slot #1025206
Block Hash: 7HSFZ67NQNPDDhGGUzEgd3afVxpEoKoox9ZHuJE9u5BR
Previous Block Hash: 4Qw6EnjmXD9PJWpA2QWoZZK2zPRhbVBeyPqCsVB4epSy
```

#### Livestreaming Blocks

You can choose to start at the latest slot and start livestreaming Solana blocks to Arweave with the `livestream`. You can then query those blocks via **`ArQL`**.

```bash
$ solarweave livestream

Transmitted Solana Block to Arweave with Parent Slot #1025206
Solana Block Hash: 7HSFZ67NQNPDDhGGUzEgd3afVxpEoKoox9ZHuJE9u5BR
```

#### Caching all Blocks

If you want to start caching every block and not just new ones. You can run the `cache` command.

```bash
$ solarweave cache

Cache is at Block 1025207, latest block is 1925007

Transmitted Solana Block to Arweave with Parent Slot #1025206
Solana Block Hash: 7HSFZ67NQNPDDhGGUzEgd3afVxpEoKoox9ZHuJE9u5BR
```

**Note that both the livestream and cache command will periodically notify you which block they're at.**

----

## Additional Configuration

#### Local streaming

For testing purposes. You might want to store blocks locally. All you need to do is pass the `--local` flag to Solarweave.

```bash
$ solarweave livestream --local
```

This will start streaming blocks to a JSON file `solarweave.cache.json`. If you want to stream to a different file, use:

```bash
$ solarweave livestream --local --localFile /path/to/solarweave.cache.json
```

#### Console output

You can turn off console out put by passing the `console` flag.

```bash
$ solarweave --console
```

#### Compression

This command does not impact local files. However, when storing blocks in Arweave. If you wanted to store a raw JSON string instead of a serialized binary `flatbuffer`. You can pass the `uncompressed` flag.

```bash
$ solarweave --uncompressed
```

#### RPC URL

If you want to query blocks from a different RPC url. You can use the `url` flag.

```bash
$ solarweave --url https://devnet.solana.com
```

#### Database tag

You can change the `database` tag for `ArQL` by using the `database` flag. This will change `database` tag and can help you navigate blocks from different networks.

```bash
$ solarweave --database devnet
```

#### Increasing throughput

You can change the rate and speed at which Solarweave processes blocks by using the `--parallelize` flag. The number you specify is the number of blocks that Solarweave will process at a time. The default is 1, but say you were working with a local validator. You could easily bump it to 8 or 16.

```bash
$ solarweave --parallelize 8
```

#### Benchmarking

If you wanted to keep track of the stats for Solarweave. You can use the `--benchmark` flag. It will store in `benchmark.json` how long it took for each block to be processed as well as the final size of the block.

```bash
$ solarweave --benchmark
```

#### Double Checking

If in any case you didn't want to double check that if a block was already submitted to Arweave. You can use the `--noverify` flag.

```bash
$ solarweave --noverify
```

----

## Finding Blocks with ArQL

Each block is supplied several tags in order to help you traverse the database. The top level tags are as follows.

##### database

As mentioned in the **Additional Configuration** section. The database tag should be used to identify which chain (or archive version) of Solana you're navigating.

##### parentSlot

This is the parent slot provided by the confirmed block.

##### slot

This is the slot of the confirmed block.

##### blockhash

This is the blockhash provided by the confirmed block.

### Transaction tags

In the case you ever wanted to navigate blocks by a specific transaction, account key or signature. You absolutely can, however, transactions, account keys and signatures may need to be iterated over several indices in order to find a match. The anatomy of transaction tags are as follows.

##### signatures

Signatures are tagged in the following way:

```bash
tx-{transaction index}-signature-{signature index}
```

Where `{transaction index}` is the index of the transaction in the Block and `{signature index}` is the index of the signature in the transaction.

**Example**

```bash
tx-0-signature-0
tx-1-signature-0
tx-2-signature-2
```

##### accountKey

Account Keys are tagged in the following way:

```bash
tx-{transaction index}-accountKey-{account key index}
```

Where `{transaction index}` is the index of the transaction in the Block and `{account key index}` is the index of the account key in the transaction.

**Example**

```bash
tx-0-accountKey-0
tx-1-accountKey-0
tx-2-accountKey-2
```

##### programIdIndex

Program IDs are tagged in the following way:

```bash
tx-{transaction index}-programIdIndex-{program id}
```

Where `{transaction index}` is the index of the transaction in the Block and `{program id}` is the index of the program id in the transaction.

**Example**

```bash
tx-0-programIdIndex-0
tx-1-programIdIndex-0
tx-2-programIdIndex-2
```

#### Additional transaction tags

In the case you may need to refine your `ArQL` query. You can use the following tags to navigate Solarweave.

##### numReadonlySignedAccounts

Which is the `numReadonlySignedAccounts` of the transaction

**Example**

```bash
tx-0-numReadonlySignedAccounts
tx-1-numReadonlySignedAccounts
```

##### numReadonlyUnsignedAccounts

Which is the `numReadonlyUnsignedAccounts` of the transaction

**Example**

```bash
tx-0-numReadonlyUnsignedAccounts
tx-1-numReadonlyUnsignedAccounts
```

##### numRequiredSignatures

Which is the `numRequiredSignatures` of the transaction

**Example**

```bash
tx-0-numRequiredSignatures
tx-1-numRequiredSignatures
```
